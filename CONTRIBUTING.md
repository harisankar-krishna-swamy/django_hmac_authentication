## Feature proposals, Bug reports

Open issues on GitHub. Always include 

1) What exists and why it needs to change. 
2) Try in the test environment and ideally in a separate project with this package as a dependency.
3) List steps to reproduce issues.
4) If available, provide screenshots or videos.

## Pull requests, coding standards

Standard linting and formatting tools are used as listed in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
When in doubt follow what the surrounding code's standard does. 
As far as code goes, think in terms of 

1) Maintainability
2) Efficiency and readability
3) Add tests. Do not just tweak existing tests
